# Modern Exquisite Shell (MESH)

MESH was born from a shell design task given by ALX SE.

## The Creators

MESH was built by two ALX students, Ifedayo Oni and Muhammad Yusuf.

### Ifedayo
I personally learnt how to write highly organized code. I also learnt the thought process of a C developer, and got to master various functions in C; Some of which are `execve`, `fork`, `isatty` etc.

## Features
- Non-interative mode via piping
- Interactive repl mode
- Argument handling
